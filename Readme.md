# Overview
This repository is an MMO game server project developed using C# and .NET. It implements a basic server architecture and socket communication, aiming for a stable and scalable server. The project was created to gain practical experience in server development utilizing C# and .NET.

<br>



# Feature


1. Network Communication: 
  - Implements client-server communication using UDP sockets method it likes send/receive method . 
<br>

2. Multithreading:
  - Establishes a multithreaded environment for handling multiple client connections by using spine lock.  
<br>
  
3. Packet Serialization/Deserialization:
  - Handles data serialization and deserialization using Protocol Buffers..  
<br>

4. Job Queue:
  - Implements a job queue system for efficient management and sequential execution of server tasks( Command Design pattern).

# Core technologies


**1. Client Session management** 
- Singleton Pattern: Provides a globally accessible single instance _session ensuring a single session manager throughout the application.
- Session Data Management: Uses a synchronized dictionary _sessions to store and manage client sessions with unique IDs, secured by _lock for thread safety.
- Session Management Methods: Supports creation (Generate), retrieval (Find), and removal (Remove) of client sessions.
- Thread Safety: Ensures thread-safe operations by synchronizing dictionary access using the _lock object..
<br>

**2. Packet Manaagement** - RESTful API backend for JSON communication. 

- Packet Handling Mapping Table:
Defines mappings (_makeFunc, _handler) to dynamically associate packet IDs with their creation and handling logic.

- Packet Registration System:
Organizes packet processing by registering specific packet types with their corresponding handlers during initialization.

- Packet Reception and Processing:
Processes incoming network data by identifying packet types and delegating them to appropriate handlers.

- Packet Creation and Handling:
Generates and dispatches packet instances, linking raw data to their handling routine
<br>

**3. Unity Networking** - Connects to a server using DNS, transmits data via ServerSession, and asynchronously processes network packets through PacketQueue and PacketManager within Unity's update loop..

# Deployment

## 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudoyh/MMOgameServer.git

cd MMOgameServer

```

<br>

## 2. Configuring Solution Properties

1. Open Solution Explorer: In Visual Studio, open the Solution Explorer.
2. Access Properties: Right-click on the solution in the Solution Explorer.
3. Select Properties: Choose "Properties" from the context menu.
4. Navigate to Startup Project: Go to "Common Properties" > "Startup Project".
5. Choose Multiple Startup Projects: Select the "Multiple startup projects" option.
S6. et Project Actions: Find both the server project and the dummy client project in the list. Set the "Action" for both to "Start".
7. Save Changes: Click "OK" to save the settings.
8. Run Simultaneously: Now, when you press F5 or the Start Debugging button, both projects will run at the same time.

## 3. Run the unity

- Click â–¶ Play in the Unity Editor
